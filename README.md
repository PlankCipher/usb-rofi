usb-rofi
========

### Overview

**usb-rofi** is a simple tool for help the management of USB flash drives using the rofi app
launcher and udev. It may be used in combination with the udev rule `usb_rofi.rules`, who will be
responsible for trigger the `usb_mgr` script when a new device is attached to the system, who in
turn will prompt the user for the action to be performed. The main usage for this tool is for tiling
window managers such as i3, dmw, bspwm, etc.

### Dependencies

- rofi
- notify-send

### Installation

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/carvalhudo/usb-rofi.git && cd usb-rofi
$ sudo /bin/sh install
```

### Usage

After the installation, the `usb-rofi` is ready to detect and notify when a new flash drive is
attached to the system. In order to improve the usability, itâ€™s recommended bind a hotkey to
unmount devices easily. In my case (i3), would be something like that:

```bash
bindsym $mod+u exec "qsudo PATH/usb_mgr -u"
```
